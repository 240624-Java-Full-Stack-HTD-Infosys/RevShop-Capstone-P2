# Project 2 (capstone) - RevShop E-commerce SPA
The RevShop project aims to develop a secure, user-friendly, and versatile e-commerce application for both buyers and sellers. The core functionalities for buyers include browsing products, 
adding products to a cart, checkout, and payment processing. Sellers can add products, manage inventory, and fulfill orders. The project's completion will be demonstrated through a cloud-hosted 
working version, technical presentation, and associated diagrams. 

## Delivery
Final delivery of the project will require:
 - A portable container of your Spring server hosted in the cloud
 - A react SPA hosted in the cloud
 - Source code for both client and server in the project repo
 - An architectural diagram of the client/server application
 - An entity relationship diagram of the database
 - A demonstration of the app
